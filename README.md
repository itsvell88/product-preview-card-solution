## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

(1) I learned how to use 'picture' mark up better, and how to utilise it for responsive images across media.
(2) I learned to optimised flex usage for responsive layout.
(3) Also, adding button to the page.

### Continued development

I'm comfortable and now familiar in planning the content & containers before coding the HTML. I will keep adding short note and short descriptions if needed because it helps me find issues quicker. I want to be more comfortable in using grid because I've been relying too much on flex.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tutorials](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - This helped me to better understanding the usage of CSS custom properties with clear step by step guidance.
- [HTML & CSS Cheatsheet](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Help me find suitable functions and code to use in developing the web page.
